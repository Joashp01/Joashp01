## 🧑‍💻 About Me
I’m evolving from the early days of university “spaghetti code” into a developer who applies **industry standards** and **architectural best practices**.  
My focus is on writing clean, maintainable code that follows **SOLID principles**, embraces **design patterns**, and ensures the right architectural standards are met.  

💡 *"Code is not just about solving problems — it’s about solving them the right way."*
